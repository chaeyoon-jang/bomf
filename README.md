# Model Fusion through Bayesian Optimization in Language Model Fine-Tuning

This repository contains the code for our paper: **[Model Fusion through Bayesian Optimization in Language Model Fine-Tuning]()**, to appear in the **NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight presentation**. In this paper, we propose a novel model fusion technique that optimizes both the desired metrics and loss through **multi-objective Bayesian optimization**. Additionally, to effectively select hyperparameters, we establish a two-stage procedure by integrating Bayesian optimization processes into our framework.
